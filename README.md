## Features

This template standardizes and speeds up the creation of a project for data journalism.

- Brings the scaffolding of a project with the help of a [directory structure](#directory-structure) designed around data pipelines.

- Improves the analysis process with established phases from a typical data [workflow](#workflow).

- Installs useful [python packages](#python-packages) during data analysis: pandas, numpy and plotly.

- Automates the creation of a [virtual environment](#python-virtual-environment) in order to make an isolated and reproducible data project.

- Initializes a local [git](#initializa-git) repository for the purpose of managing a version control of the project.
