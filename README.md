## Features

This template standardizes and speeds up the creation of a project for data journalism.

- Brings the scaffolding of a project with the help of a [directory structure](#directory-structure) designed around data pipelines.

- Improves the analysis process with established phases from a typical data [workflow](#workflow).

- Installs useful [python packages](#python-packages) during data analysis: pandas, numpy and plotly.

- Automates the creation of a [virtual environment](#python-virtual-environment) in order to make an isolated and reproducible data project.

- Initializes a local [git](#initializa-git) repository for the purpose of managing a version control of the project.

## Installation 

- ### **Quickstart**

    First you need to install [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/) either it is with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

    - Installing with pip:

    ```
    pip install cookiecutter
    ```

    - Installing with conda:

    ```
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install cookiecutter
    ```

- ### **Start a new project**

    Now install the data journalism template.

    ```
    cookiecutter https://github.com/fer-aguirre/cookiecutter-data-journalism
    ```
- ### **Optional**

    In addition you can install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) to create a virtual environment during the project generation.

    ```
    pip install pipenv
    ```

    The template works with notebooks, in case you don't have a set up for [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), run the following command. 

    ```
    pip install jupyterlab notebook
    ```

## Workflow

1. Set up the project
2. Process data
3. Analyze data
4. Visualize data
5. Write a report
